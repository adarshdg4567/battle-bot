## 11/1/2025 - starting drawing my ideas  

just noticed that 
blueprint was announced and it's a great time to make a project that I've always wanted. 2 BattleBots to break each other. The big challenge for this project is to make sure they both work in order to do damage.

I started by watching a lot of BattleBots and trying to find different designs from different weight classes. I then drew a couple designs that I liked.

## 11/1/2025 9:21 AM - starting drawing my ideas  

just noticed that 
blueprint was announced and it's a great time to make a project that I've always wanted. 2 BattleBots to break each other. The big challenge for this project is to make sure they both work in order to do damage.

I started by watching a lot of BattleBots and trying to find different designs from different weight classes. I then drew a couple designs that I liked.

## 11/1/2025 9:28 AM - ideation and diagrams ;)  

Now that I had the idea, I wanted to determine how to build it. I first decided what main components I need to make this idea possible. Each robot needs to be controlled (user feedback), drive, and spin up a weapon system. Once I had an idea of the requirements, I made some high level diagrams to figure how to wire the robots. I also made a power distrubution diagram. This part is quite expensive because different components requires different voltages. In my past experiences, power is the hardest for the projects. This time, I want to wire as neatly as possible. I then broke the BOM into two main sections. Electoronics and Mechanical. After I listed everything I classified them into things I already have and things that I needed to buy. Afterwards, I went on amazon (cheapest and fastest place to get electronics for me) to find the items that I'm missing. I spent a lot of time trying to optimize the budget and keep the cost low.

## 11/1/2025 9:37 AM - started cading the design  

I spent a lot of time cading out the design. I first started by 150 mm x 150 mm square and placed each component inside where I think would best fit. After I was happy with it I moved on making it 3D. I worked on the front where I had to learn how to create planes at angles to create the angled ramps at the front of the robot. I also caded up the weapon assembly for bot 1. For bot 2, I took similar layout from bot 1 and changed where the weapon is and its support.
